    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known where life developed and found habitability. <br>
        This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. <br>
        Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, spanning 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, <br> 
        most of which is located in the form of continential landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's <br>
        land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes,<br>
         rivers and atmospheric water together. Earth's land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p> <br>
<h2 align="center"><b><u>INNER PORTION OF EARTH</u></b></h2> <br>

<p>Earth's outer core is a fluid layer about 2,400 km (1,500 mi) thick [37% of the radius, 15.6% of the volume] and composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above <br>Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle.[28] Its outer boundary lies 2,890 km (1,800 mi) beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150 km (3,200 mi) beneath the Earth's surface. Earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the planet Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 km (760 mi),<br> which is about 19% of Earth's radius [0.7% of volume] or 70% of the Moon's radius.[29][30]
    The inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally composed primarily of iron and some nickel. Since this layer is able to transmit shear waves (transverse seismic waves), it must be solid. Experimental evidence has at times been inconsistent with current crystal models of the core.[31] <br> Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000 K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies.[32][33] <br>The laser studies create plasma,[34] and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will depend on whether the inner core is a solid or is a plasma with the density of a solid. This is an area of active research.

<h3 align="center"><u><b>GLOBAL WARMING</b></u></h3>

    Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. <br>This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change."
Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. <br> The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia.

<h4 align="center"><u><b>HOW TO STOP POLLUTION</b></u></h4>
<p>1. Making it easier to recycle
    It can be difficult to figure out what personal items are recyclable — <br>including plastic goods like bottles, bags or clothes — and where to recycle them.
    In 2021, <br>we introduced a new group of recycling attributes for Google Business Profiles on Search and Maps, <br> allowing local storefronts and shops to show the recycling services they offer and helping people share this information with others in their community. <br> Now you can search for nearby recycling drop-off locations — through searches like "plastic bottle recycling near me" — all over the world. <br>
    2. Helping people find pre-owned items
    It’s no secret that the fashion industry contributes significantly to emissions and waste: <br>Clothing is responsible for about four percent of carbon emissions. <br>What’s more, each year the fashion industry uses 342 million barrels of petroleum to produce plastic-based fibers such as polyester, nylon or acrylic.</p>
